### Data Management platform features and evaluation criterion


The goal of this dociument is to evaluate various tools and software that can play a role in data management platform solution. In order to start this discussion first we focused on the following data management platform (DMP) features: 

* One entry point to many storage services and data services
* Usable interface to compute services, policies defining and tracking data transitions
* Support for (automated) execution of data policies which define workflows and behaviour of data and users
* Data sharing of data between users of the Data Management Platform
* Policies and interfaces to share data with external users (secure, private) 
* Well defined transition between data storage locations and data application environments such as compute environments
* Well defined transition between active data and archived or published data

Our goal is to think about both general and specific use cases and then try to highlight the components and strengths of each tool. Each use case and research data management need are unique and requires various customizations. Thus we also identified the following aspects for evaluation and implementation as each solution sometime focuses on specific problems. So a comprehensive data management platform will include a variety of solutions and customizations. 

* Managing databases, disparate data sets and storage resources 
* Metadata management 
* Repositories (including long term archive) 
* Sharing/Publication
* Extensions/external tools 

Software/tools: 

1. [iRODS](https://irods.org/) 
Used for data virtualization, federation, discovery (from variety of storage resources), workflow automation via policy engine. 
2. [Denodo](https://www.denodo.com/en) 
Creates data virtualization layer by connecting various  structured data sources. Provides  unified access for consuming applications.
3. [CKAN](https://ckan.org/) 
Data portal, repository
4. [Figshare](https://figshare.com/) 
Digital repository 
5. [Immuta](https://www.immuta.com/) 
Focused on big data and data science applications (provides data management and portal solution) 
6. [Metadata Management for Applied Sciences (MASi)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X17305344) 
7. [Starfish](http://www.starfishstorage.com/) 
8. [StrongLink](https://www.strongboxdata.com/stronglink) 
9. [Clowder](https://clowder.ncsa.illinois.edu/) 

NOTE: the comparison is baesd on various functions and features that we encountered in research data management ecosystem. This is not a product review or feature comparison.
